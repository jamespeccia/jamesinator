Automated cryptocurrency trading bot that takes advantage of varying prices on different exchanges (Bybit and Phemex).

This program is currently hosted on Google Cloud in Singapore for millisecond trade entries and exits. It is also equipped with a discord logger, to alert for any possible errors.

This is a multithreaded application to allow asyncronous trade placement and monitoring, websocket listening, and an HTTP server to allow changes in its configuation during runtime.

(Current API keys are for the testnets, so I didn't bother removing them.)
